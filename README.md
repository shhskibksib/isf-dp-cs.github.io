# Making with Code

Making with Code is a new, old approach to teaching computer science based in Constructionism. It’s new because it draws on the tools of modern computational practice and is grounded in youths’ digital worlds. It is old because technologists have been dreaming of an empowering, transformative integration of education and technology for over half a century.
