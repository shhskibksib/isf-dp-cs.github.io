* Interrupt requires the device to flag the computer.
* Processor receives interruption signal and services the interrupt by calling the appropriate system subroutine for interrupt processing/interrupt handler.
* And hence the computer’s time is not wasted whilst the swipe device is idle.

{{< /expand >}}

**(a.ii) Describe two issues resulting from the website being viewed on various devices, such as desktops and smartphones. [4]**

{{< expand "Answer" >}}
Award [4 max]
* Screens that are different sizes (for example, 3–6 diagonal inches for a phone, and 9–12 diagonal inches for a tablet, size of 13–17 inches for a notebook screen, and a desktop screen size of 20–30 inches).
* Can still have the same screen resolution (for example, a laptop could have a 13-inch screen with a resolution of 1280 x 800 and a desktop computer could have a 17 inch monitor with the same 1280 x 800 resolution).
* But physically smaller screen will not show less of the website.
* The screen with the higher resolution will be able to show you more of the website because that screen has more pixels and the image will be sharper.
* But elements on the screen (icons and text) will look smaller.
* Most mobile displays currently have screens with fewer pixels than desktop displays and are physically smaller.
* Typing on small on-screen keyboards is difficult.
* Less precision (clicking a 12-pixel-high text link with a mouse is no problem but tapping the same link with fingers could be difficult).
* There is no mouse pointer so there is no concept of "hovering" over a page element/ remaining in an uncertain state.
* Most modern touch screens allow zooming.
* Allow the user to perform gestures using one or more fingers, such as swiping/pinching.
Note: Award marks not only for issues for a viewer but also for issues for a creator of the interface.

* Thus the role of OS is
* To keep track of who is using which resource.
* To grant resource requests.

{{< expand "Answer" >}}
Award [6 max]
Award [2 max] for evidence that:
* Sensors (input devices) detect/measure the water level.
* Sensors detect/measure the temperature (of the water).
* Sensors detect/measure the dampness/moisture level of the clothes.
* Sensors also detect movement of the machine's drum and other associated actions.
* Sensors continuously take readings/measurements (in the context of above) and send these readings to the processor.
Award [2 max] for evidence that:
* Processor controls sensors, valves and actuators responsible for controlling the parts that clean clothes.
* Processor determines what actions the machine should take next.
* The washing machine has been programmed/ it goes through a process of running its internal programs.
* Processor compares readings with pre-set values (in the context of the various sensors).
* If the readings fall outside of the specified range, the processor sends a message to the output transducer to switch on/off ... (in the context of part of the washing machine).
Award [2 max] for evidence that:
* Output transducers are used for turning on and off devices that control the rest of the machine.
* Such as the motors that spin the tub.
* Or the water pump.
Example:
Once the start button is pushed the washing machine begins to dump water into the drum, a sensor will detect that the water level has been reached.
Based on the setting, the processor will allow the water to flow only to a predetermined level.
It will send the signal to output transducers to shut off the water.
And begin the agitation process.
Once the timer tells that it is time, processor sends signal to output transducer to stop agitating.
It then begins the spin process/ removing the dirty water from the machine at the end of the spin cycle, the washing machine's processor sends signal to turn on the water pump and sucking it out of the machine.

**Some cars have adaptive cruise control. This uses RADAR technology and a processor to ensure the car stays the same distance away from the car in front.**

**(b) Explain how the interaction between the inputs, processing and the outputs of the feedback loop ensure the car stays the same distance away from the car in front. [6]**

{{< expand "Answer" >}}
Award [6 max]
* Sensor (continuously) collecting data (related to the distance between the two vehicles).
* Data is converted to digital using ADC…
* …and sent to the processor.
* Processor has access to pre-set data (minimum distance required between the two cars).
* Processor compares the input data against stored/pre-set data.
* If the vehicle is too close, the processor sends a signal to an actuator to apply the brakes/ an output signal (for example, warning light on the dashboard/ audible warning) to the driver to apply break.
* If the car has fallen back from the car in front, the processor sends a signal to an actuator to apply acceleration/ an output signal to the driver to apply acceleration.
* This process is constantly looped (feedback loop).

**A system with many functions operating independently could be managed using either centralized or decentralized processing.**

**(c) Discuss the use of centralized and decentralized processing in the context of control systems such as those involved in the operation of motor vehicles. [5]**

{{< expand "Answer" >}}
Award [5 max]
Award [2 max] for centralized processing
* Centralized processing would allow the different features of the car to be controlled by a single processor.
* … this means that different features of the car are less likely to impact on the operation of other features, as the central processor can coordinate them.
Award [2 max] for decentralized / distributed processing
* Decentralized processing allows each of the car’s features to have its own processor.
* … enabling each feature to function independently/more quickly.
Award [1 max] for concluding statement
* Centralized processing is more complex for the manufacturer to program, but is possibly safer as the different components coordinate.
* Centralised processing is more expensive to achieve as the whole system needs to be coordinated in real time.
* Decentralised processing has a faster response (time due to the use of multiple smaller PLCs).
* Decentralised processing is simpler/cheaper for the car manufacturer as they can use standard parts that are already programmed, but it is more difficult to get them to coordinate with each other.
* Decentralised processing allows scalability, the subsystems can be easily customised.
* A crash in a centralized system would result in failure of the whole system / a critical system failure so would have far greater consequences than in a decentralized system where the system may be able to partially function hence are riskier than decentralized ones.

{{< expand "Answer" >}}
Award [3 max]
* Autonomous vehicles can be seen as more dangerous to pedestrians/cyclists.

* The ethical consideration is how might the processor decide whether to avoid the cyclist to hit a pedestrian instead (trolley problem).
* When autonomous vehicle control systems are perfected.
* … they should be safer than human drivers.
* … it may then be an ethical consideration as to whether a human who cannot drive should be the responsible person in the autonomous vehicle?.
* An autonomous driving system could collect detailed information about the movements of the car.
* … this information could reveal where individuals go, and raise privacy concerns.
* … which could be exploited for commercial gain/ be considered as a form of surveillance (an ethical consideration).
* There may be times when an accident is unavoidable (the trolley problem).
* The autonomous vehicle has to make a ‘decision’ about who to hit.
* In this case is the driver, the manufacturer, the software engineer or the third party accountable?.
