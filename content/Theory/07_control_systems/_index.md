## Key Terms

| Term                        | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                          |

| Microprocessors             | Small processors used in many control systems to process data and perform control functions.                                                                                     |
| Output Transducer           | A device that converts electrical signals from a control system into physical action or output, such as motion or heat.                                                          |
| Feedback Loops              | A system in which the output of a process is monitored and fed back into the system to adjust the input, ensuring that the desired output is achieved.                           |
| Embedded Systems            | Computer systems that are integrated into other devices or equipment, often performing control functions.                                                                        |
| Centrally Controlled System | A control system in which all functions are managed by a single central controller.                                                                                              |
| Distributed System          | A control system in which control functions are distributed across multiple controllers, working together to manage the system.                                                  |
| Autonomous Agents           | A type of control system that operates independently and makes decisions based on a set of rules or objectives, often used in robotics and artificial intelligence applications. |
