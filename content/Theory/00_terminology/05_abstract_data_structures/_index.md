| Term                  | Meaning                                                                                                                                    |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 2D arrays             | A data structure that stores elements in a grid-like format with rows and columns.                                                         |
| Stacks                | A data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, where elements are added and removed from the same end.              |
| Queues                | A data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, where elements are added to one end and removed from the other end. |
| Heaps                 | A tree-based data structure that is used to implement priority queues, where the highest priority element is always at the root.           |
| Linked lists          | A data structure that stores elements in nodes, where each node contains a value and a pointer to the next node.                           |
| Double linked lists   | A linked list where each node has a pointer to both the next and the previous node.                                                        |
| Circular linked lists | A linked list where the last node points to the first node, creating a circular structure.                                                 |
| Pointers              | A variable that stores the memory address of another variable.                                                                             |
| Binary trees          | A tree-based data structure where each node has at most two children.                                                                      |
| Non-binary trees      | A tree-based data structure where each node can have more than two children.                                                               |
| Nodes                 | An individual element of a data structure, such as a linked list or a tree.                                                                |
| Parent node           | A node that has one or more children.                                                                                                      |
| Left-child node       | The child node of a parent that appears to the left.                                                                                       |
| Right-child node      | The child node of a parent that appears to the right.                                                                                      |
| Subtree node          | A smaller tree that is part of a larger tree.                                                                                              |
| Root node             | The topmost node in a tree.                                                                                                                |
| Leaf node             | A node that has no children.                                                                                                               |
| Tree traversal        | The process of visiting all nodes in a tree data structure.                                                                                |
| Pre-order traversal   | A type of tree traversal where the root node is visited first, followed by the left subtree and then the right subtree.                    |
| Post-order traversal  | A type of tree traversal where the left subtree is visited first, followed by the right subtree, and then the root node.                   |
| In-order traversal    | A type of tree traversal where the left subtree is visited first, followed by the root node, and then the right subtree.                   |
| Recursion             | A programming technique where a function calls itself.                                                                                     |
| Base case             | The terminating condition for a recursive function.                                                                                        |
| Recursive case        | The condition where a recursive function continues to call itself.                                                                         |
