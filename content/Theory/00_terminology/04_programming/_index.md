| Term                                                    | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| AND                                                  | A Boolean operator that returns true if and only if both of its inputs are true.                                                   |
| OR                                                   | A Boolean operator that returns true if at least one of its inputs is true.                                                        |
| NOT                                                  | A Boolean operator that negates the input, returning true if the input is false, and vice versa.                                   |
| NAND                                                 | A Boolean operator that returns false if and only if both of its inputs are true.                                                  |
| NOR                                                  | A Boolean operator that returns true if both of its inputs are false.                                                              |
| XOR                                                  | A Boolean operator that returns true if and only if exactly one of its inputs is true.                                             |
