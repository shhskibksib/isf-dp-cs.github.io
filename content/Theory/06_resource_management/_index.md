**4. Explain how an operating system manages peripherals. [3]**

{{< expand "Answer" >}}
Award [3 max] 
* OS keeps tracks of all peripheral devices (the I/O controller) / decides which process gets the device when and for how much time / allocates and de-allocates devices;
* OS works with device drivers and the basic input/output system (BIOS) to perform hardware tasks
/ the necessary drivers (for every peripheral) are built into the OS and/or when a new peripheral is added software / device driver provided by a hardware maker is installed into the operating system (to tell the computer's OS how to work with the peripheral/hardware) (because without a device driver the OS would not be able to communicate with this peripheral device);
* A device driver translates the OS's instructions into a language (analogue signals) that the device can understand;
* There are various types of device drivers for peripherals (such as keyboards, mice, disk drives, controllers, printers, graphics cards, ports, etc.);
* Device drivers run in the OS kernel space (in the part of the OS that directly interacts with the physical structure of the system) (and implement functions such as open, close, read, write);
* The running application/user's program can make a call to device driver functions which provide an interface between user space and kernel space;
* Example answer:
    * An OS manages peripherals via their respective drivers;
    * For example, sound card drivers;
    * are necessary so the OS knows exactly how to translate the 1s and 0s (that comprise the MP3 file) into audio signals;
    * that the sound card can output to headphones / speakers;
{{< /expand >}}

**5. Distinguish between the use of time slicing and priorities in the scheduling of processes by an operating system. [3]**

{{< expand "Answer" >}}
Award [3 max].
* Prioritizing enables execution of the (highest priority) process until a higher priority task enters;
* The OS/scheduler put processes (jobs) in the right place in a queue in order of priority (accept examples, an I/O operation has higher priority than calculations because it uses less CPU time);
* Time slicing allows process to execute for a fixed time/each process is given a fixed period of time (time slice) for which the process is allowed to run/;
* The scheduler is run once every time slice to choose the next process to run;
* Note: Award [1 max] if evident that the scheduler software is responsible for organizing all of the processes that need servicing/responsible for looking at what resources are available (CPU time and peripheral devices) /responsible for making decisions about what order to put all the processes in (when to start any particular process, and when to finish it);

* Interrupt requires the device to flag the computer.
* Processor receives interruption signal and services the interrupt by calling the appropriate system subroutine for interrupt processing/interrupt handler.
* And hence the computer’s time is not wasted whilst the swipe device is idle.

* But elements on the screen (icons and text) will look smaller.
* Most mobile displays currently have screens with fewer pixels than desktop displays and are physically smaller.
* Typing on small on-screen keyboards is difficult.
* Less precision (clicking a 12-pixel-high text link with a mouse is no problem but tapping the same link with fingers could be difficult).

* Most modern touch screens allow zooming.
* Allow the user to perform gestures using one or more fingers, such as swiping/pinching.

* Output transducers are used for turning on and off devices that control the rest of the machine.
* Such as the motors that spin the tub.

* Based on the setting, the processor will allow the water to flow only to a predetermined level.
* It will send the signal to output transducers to shut off the water.
* And begin the agitation process.
* Once the timer tells that it is time, processor sends signal to output transducer to stop agitating.
* It then begins the spin process/ removing the dirty water from the machine at the end of the spin cycle, the washing machine's processor sends signal to turn on the water pump and sucking it out of the machine.
