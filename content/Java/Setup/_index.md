<!-- Note: if IntelliJ IDEA is not working for you, you can use [this online compiler](https://www.jdoodle.com/online-java-compiler/) -->

## [0] Create a GitHub Account   

GitHub is a convenient, industry-standard way for programmers to share code with eachother. You can think of it as Google Docs for code. It's great for collaborating with a team, accessing your code from anywhere, seeing a history of your progress, and backing up your work.

We will be using it in this class as a way for you to access examples/starter code, and for you to submit your work. 


{{<code-action "Create a GitHub Account" >}} [here](https://github.com/signup?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out&ref_page=%2F&source=header-home) *(if you don't already have one)*  




{{<code-action "Fill in" >}} [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSewfHNTe43JmIdH8D9IMXCuRmhgfOmVcJPVLS9bWhQslv7NoA/viewform?usp=sf_link) **to tell me your GitHub username.**

I will add you to our **`isf-dp-cs` GitHub organization**. Look out for an email inviting you to join.
