### Bookshelf



#### printBooks()


## Extensions

### Validation: Username restrictions
A username must be between at least 4-15 characters long. 

If a user tries to make an account with an invalid username, they should instead get some default username.
If a user tries to change their username with an invalid username, the username should stay the same

### Validation: No duplicates 
If a user tries to add in a bookshelf that already exists, they should receive an error message and the new bookshelf should not be created.

If a user tries to add a book to the same bookshelf twice, they should receive an error message and the book should not be added.

### Validation: Valid ratings
If a user wants to set the rating to something negative, or something over 5, you should not let them.

### Remove books from bookshelves
If you want to remove a book from a bookshelf, consider all the places that must be updated.

### Delete bookshelves
If you want to delete bookshelves, first make sure that they are empty. -->
