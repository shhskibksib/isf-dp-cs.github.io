## Setup

💻 Create a new class called `Patterns`. It does not need any properties. 

💻 Create a main method for this class.  As you write each new method below, you can use the main method to test the method. 


## Checker Pattern

🚨 Note: <br> `System.out.println()` prints the text on a new line. 
<br> `System.out.print()` prints the text on the same line.


💻 Write a method that prompts the user for the size of the pattern, and prints the checker pattern as shown:

```java
Enter the size: 5
# # # # # 
 # # # # # 
# # # # # 
 # # # # # 
# # # # # 
```

```java
Enter the size: 1
#
```

```java
Enter the size: 3
# # # 
 # # # 
# # # 
```

## Triangle Pattern

🚨 Note: <br> `System.out.println()` prints the text on a new line. 
<br> `System.out.print()` prints the text on the same line.


💻 Write a method that prompts the user for the size of the pattern, and prints the checker pattern as shown:

```java
Enter the size: 5
*
**
***
****
*****
```

```java
Enter the size: 4
*
**
***
****
```

```java
Enter the size: 1
*
```

## Z Pattern

🚨 Note: <br> `System.out.println()` prints the text on a new line. 
<br> `System.out.print()` prints the text on the same line.


💻 Write a method that prompts the user for the size of the pattern, and prints the checker pattern as shown:

```java
Enter the size: 5
*****
   * 
  *  
 *   
*****
```

```java
Enter the size: 3
***
 * 
***
```

```java
Enter the size: 1
*
```

## Hill Pattern

🚨 Note: <br> `System.out.println()` prints the text on a new line. 
<br> `System.out.print()` prints the text on the same line.


💻 Write a method that prompts the user for the size of the pattern, and prints the checker pattern as shown:

```java
Enter the size: 5
    ^     
   ^^^    
  ^^^^^   
 ^^^^^^^  
^^^^^^^^^ 
```

```java
Enter the size: 4
   ^    
  ^^^   
 ^^^^^  
^^^^^^^ 
```

```java
Enter the size: 1
*
```

## Multiplication Table

🚨 Note: <br> `System.out.println()` prints the text on a new line. 
<br> `System.out.print()` prints the text on the same line.


💻 Write a method that prompts the user for the size of the pattern, and prints the checker pattern as shown:
